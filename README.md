## FlowFields
Flow fields are simply something that I have a fixation on and this is a project creating a simple design with them. <br>

## How it works?

Flow fields are generated by creating a map of velocities and releasing a particle into this field so that you can 
start to see some type of behavior of this field. It creates a very visually stimulating simulation that you may 
have seen being used for wall papers. Below is an example of the flow fields where each arrow points in the direction
of the velocity. <br>

This map is generated using [Perlin Noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perlin_noise#:~:text=Perlin%20noise%20is%20a%20procedural,details%20are%20the%20same%20size.). 
If you are astute you may have noticed that despite being "noisy," two points next to each other are never 
completely random but rather somewhat close to each other. This is a property of Perlin Noise, despite being
random in totality points next to each other are not gonna be completely different. Otherwise, the particules will be
torn between where they want to go and no "flow," will emerge. Below is the first result I got: <br>

As you can see the most popular path is in the middle along a line that looks almost sinusoidal. But I want to
see what the flow field looks like based off how frequently the particles travel through there. To solve that, I 
made it so the particles are randomly spanwed and they leave a trail. That way less common areas will be investigated
but they will leave a weaker (less bright) trail than the most prevelant ones. Please see one final example below!


## One Last Picture for Fun
This one was generated after many more iterations than the first one, it samples the same noise however you can see that
certain paths are a lot bolder and this is because the trails have been allowed time to make the
most common paths bolder. <br>
